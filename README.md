I Hi, in this repository is the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code of a game called Snake without using Canvas.  I created this game following a tutorial in Spanish from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Programaci%C3%B3nAccesible">Programaci√≥n Accesible</a>. This channel is a very good educational channel with great projects and a spectacular explanation, go check it out if you know Spanish!  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)
